        Amongst the office blocks between stylish Shoreditch and the bustle of
        the city find our lush spot of paradise perched at the edge of Finsbury
        Square’s popular bowls green. It’s the end of our official first day of
        trading and while it’s still a week away until we have our first street
        food chefs in occupation, we’ve had a ball of a day serving up coffees,
        ice creams and soft drinks to our new (and hopefully returning)
        customers.

      <p>
        We’ll be open this week Monday to Friday from 8am to 6pm so pop in
        to say hello and to enjoy an expert barista coffee or real
        fruit ice lolly on Finsbury Square’s Patio.
